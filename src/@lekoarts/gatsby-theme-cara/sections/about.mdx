## About Me

Hi, I'm Michael! I love solving problems using the medium of software development. I grew up playing guitar
and was heavily influenced by virtuosos like Ritchie Blackmore and Randy Rhoads who created something truly unique
by combining classical technique with the kind of swing that came with rock music.
